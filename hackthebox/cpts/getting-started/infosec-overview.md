# Infosec Overview — Summary

Information security (infosec) protects data’s **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** from unauthorized access, modification, or disruption. It covers areas like network and infrastructure security, application security, digital forensics, incident response, and risk management.

**Risk Management Process:**

1. **Identify** risks (legal, technical, environmental, etc.).
2. **Analyze** their likelihood and impact.
3. **Evaluate** and decide whether to accept, avoid, control, or transfer each risk.
4. **Deal with** risks by applying mitigation or elimination measures.
5. **Monitor** risks continuously for changes in impact or likelihood.

**Red Team vs Blue Team:**

* **Red Team:** Offensive side — emulates attackers to find weaknesses (e.g., penetration testing, social engineering).
* **Blue Team:** Defensive side — strengthens systems, analyzes risks, responds to incidents, and develops policies.

**Role of a Penetration Tester:**
Pen testers identify and demonstrate vulnerabilities in networks, applications, and configurations. They help organizations understand risks, reproduce issues, and recommend mitigation. Tests can be white-box (full info), black-box (no info), or scenario-based red team assessments.
