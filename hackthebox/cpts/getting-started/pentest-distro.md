# Getting Started with a Pentest Distro — Summary

* **Know multiple OSes:** Pen testers must be comfortable with Linux and Windows and able to run attack machines from VMs, cloud boxes, client workstations (insider simulations), or the host OS.
* **Distro choice is personal:** Many Debian-based pentest distros exist (Kali, Parrot, etc.). No distro has every tool — you’ll customize a list of “must-haves” as you progress.
* **Use a fresh VM per engagement:** Always start tests from a freshly-installed VM to avoid leaking client data or mixing environments; automate setup with scripts/automation for speed and consistency.
* **Virtualization is preferred:** Run pentest VMs via Hyper-V, VirtualBox, VMware Workstation/Player, Proxmox, or ESXi. Hypervisors isolate VMs from the host and let you snapshot, replicate targets, and test exploits safely.
* **Home lab recommended:** Build a lab (old PC or server/bare-metal hypervisor) to reproduce vulnerabilities, test remediations, and practice safely.
* **Parrot / Pwnbox specifics:** Module uses Parrot OS (Pwnbox). You can deploy via **ISO** (custom install) or **OVA** (prebuilt, fast deploy). Parrot docs and forums are available for setup/config help.
* **Pwnbox & Docker:** Academy provides an in-browser Pwnbox (convenient, no local VM needed). Some targets can be run via Docker without VPN; others (e.g., AD targets) require a VPN key to access from outside the Pwnbox.
* **Practical note:** Since you picked Parrot and already installed it, you’re ready — keep an install snapshot and a small automation script to reproduce your baseline VM quickly.
